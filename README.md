COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) is a global pandemic and has spread to more than 190 countries. The motivation of this project is to provide real-time information about outbreak of new coronavirus which includes detailed information death, recovered and total active cases worldwide. This provides Country/Region and Province/state wise data and it also analyses the pattern of COVID spread using Jupyter notebook.
DATA VISUALISATION
Data Visualization is the graphical representation of data, it is a way to summarize our findngs and display it in a form that facilitates interpretation and can help in identifying trends and patterns interactively and efficiently. We use Data Visualisation to present Covid-19 data graphically and to see the patterns and insights what we are looking for.It becomes easier to grasp different datas and identify the current trend of covid-19.It is easy to create visualizations in python using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

Matplotlib - Matplotlib was the first Python data visualization library and it is still the most widely used for plotting.This allows us to access number of matplotlibâ€™s methods with less code.some libraries like Seaborn and Pandas are wrappers over matplotlib. It is a multi platform data visualization library which helps us to plot the datas of different countries which is being affected and the rate of people affected, recovered and dead by coronavirus using plots like line and graph.
Seaborn  harnesses the matplotlib power to create beautiful charts using few lines of code and it is an add-on to Matplotlib which allows us to create sleeker graphics and style our graphs more professionally.

Ipywidgets are interactive widgets(HTML) for jupyter notebooks where the notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. We used ipywidgets to display  various datas such as Death, Recovered and Affected rate of people from different countries so that we can choose any country to see the data and can visualize the changes in the data.

Folium - Python offers libraries for every data visualisation need, one such library is called Folium which comes in handy for visualising Geo data(Geographic data). Geo data is a subset of data science that deals with location based data. It is a powerful library in python was built to visualize geospatial data. Using folium, one can create a map of any location in the world of its longtitude and latitude values are known. Maps created by Folium are interactive in nature, so anyone an zoom in and zoom out once the map is rendered. We use Folium to create interactive Map for COVID-19 by using markers.Which hepls us to reach the location by clicking and tap to see the information in one particular location.
